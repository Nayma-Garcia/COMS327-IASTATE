    Set up my enviornment, had some issues getting pyrite to work but got those fixed pretty easy
    Also downloaded the skeleton code and made a method to add the sobel filter but nothing in it yet

    Watched video provided in the assignment doc that explains how the kernels work
    Also watched other youtube videos explaining how the algorithm for the edge detection worked
    Took a lot of notes until I fully understood what to do
    Also added the makefile

    Implemented the algorithm that adds the filter. Had some issues getting the right output. For a long time it was showing the edges kind of but the entire picture was grey and hard to see. 
    Then somehow I made it show complete static but I fixed it.
    Then it was showing the edges but they were extremley soft so I changed the ints to int_8 and that helped.
    I also had some issues getting the input information from the images but I just casted the images I was taking in from the method signature to int_8's and that worked.

    Finished cleaning up the code a little and added the README
