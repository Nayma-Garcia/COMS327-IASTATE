This project generates a new random 80x21 map every time the program is ran. 
The program consists of trees, paths, boulders, PokeCenter and PokeMarts, water, long grass and short grass. 
Which are placed randomly around the map. There are two paths, one that goes N-S and one that goes E-W, they connect at some point. 
In this specific program there are 4 different functions to generate the different parts of the terrain, one of them just generating the border around the entire map. 
Along with 2 more functions that print out the map and one that generates the map by putting all the other functions together.

As seen in the Makefile, I used "test" to run my program just for ease of not having to type anything long
