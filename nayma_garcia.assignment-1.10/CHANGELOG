    1:20pm: Started brainstorming on what game i wanted to make, i decided on battle ship. I started out with building the boards. I had a lot of trouble getting them set up since i was trying to do it similar to how i set up my map generation in the pokemon game.

    3:00PM: I finally got the boards set up, i used cells instead and that made it easier. I then worked on getting the computers AI set up. I struggled finding a good way to do this as well but I got something figured out. I also got the setting where the ships are set up.
