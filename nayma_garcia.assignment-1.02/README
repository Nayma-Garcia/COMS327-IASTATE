This program generates and navigates a grid-based world of maps.  You can explore the world using commands n, s, w, e, and, fly to specific coordinates. When going to new maps, if you are traveling along the same axis then the maths will align as you traverse through the maps. This program also generates the C and M's less as you move along, In some maps you will notice that there either is none, or there is only a C or only an M.
