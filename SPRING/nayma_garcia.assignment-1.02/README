This program generates a random terrain for the user to play on.
It allows the user to input n s w e q or f
    Although this functionality doesn't work as I want it to, it generates a new map but does not save it for when you go back
This program also slowly makes the generation of Pokecenters and pokemarts less and less although sometimes it doesn't work and there is an equal amount of pokecenters and marts
This assignment was very hard for me but I will work on strengthening my understanding of structs and pointers for the next assignment so that it works as it should
This program also has a function that is supposed to save the current map into a new map variable for it to them be called when going back to a previusly visited map although I am not sure it works 100%
Thank you for your hardwork and time that you have spent grading this.
