Trainers on Map

This program utilizes the professors code from the previos homework and is designed to place different trainers on a map and simulate their movement according to their respective movement algorithms. However, s the trainers are not moving as expected, even though the code appears to be correct.(it probably isnt though)

The PC stays still while the trainers are supposed to move around, although, due to my own fault in coding, they do not, and they end up printing in a strange manner, I believe this has to do with the way I have printed them

To run this program type make and then ./poke327
