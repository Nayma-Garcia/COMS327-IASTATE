    Started reading through the assignment spec pdf and was having trouble understanding what I'm even supposed to be doing
    Started researching more about dijkstra's algorithm and exactly how it works
    I also set up my enviornment as I am now using the professors code from assignemnt 1.02 because mine did not work 100%

2/12/23
    Started creating a new function to find the distances and print out the maps
    I started with copying the code from the dijkstra_path function that the professor wrote, and started finicking with it to find the distances from the hikers and rivals from the player
        The shortest path**

2/15/23
    Created a new struct to hold the different characters, including the hikers and rivals
    Made #define symbols because I couldnt get the struct to work

2/20/23
    Went back to the struct implementation
    Decided to make a new heap for the hiker and rival characters
    Kept getting identifier errors.

2/22/23
    I kept getting an error about invalid initializers and I could not figure it out. I looked it up on stack overflow and such
    I also tried to implement part of the professors algorithm with some minor changes, so far it is still not printing anything
    I am struggling a lot with this, I cannot get it to update the cost of the rivals and hikers.
    I ended up not being able to get the code to work
