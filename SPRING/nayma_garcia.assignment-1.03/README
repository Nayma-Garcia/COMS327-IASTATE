This program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the distance between two characters from the player character in a given map. The program then prints the resulting distance map. I used the professors code from 1.02 and then made some changes to his algorithm and added some of my own methods, to print the map for example.

Usage

To use the program, simply run the poke327.c file using make and then ./poke327. 

Known Issues:

Currently, the program does not correctly find the shortest path between characters. This is due to a bug in the implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. It also does not print the distance map, I think this may also be due to a bad implementation of Dijkstras Algorithm. I tried everything I knew and went to office hours but just really struggled with this assignment, I guess I just didn't understand the idea of it maybe. Thank you for taking the time to grade this.
