    Started working on getting the Ncurses to work
    Was having trouble figuring out how to run the lncurses library with the make file but after some research on the all mighty stack overflow i figured it out and it can run ncurses
    Now gonna start working on the actual assignment specs

    Im starting with making some functionality to take in the user input for quitting the game and such
    I am having a lot of trouble getting it to read user input

    Had to leave for spring break earlier than expected due to family reasons so will continue working on this after break

    My flight got delayed so I was just now able to work on this
    I am still struggling with reading the user input
    I implemented a char that is supposed to hold the user input but it is not working correctly
    I was unable to work on this assignment as much as I would have liked, it is not functioning as it should, it does not take the user input, BUT, its not broken so thats a plus, it is able to run ncurses
